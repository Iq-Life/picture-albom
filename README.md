# Picture-album
Hi there! :wave:\
This is my photo album. In This project I used TS and Material-ui library for nice design.

Clone the application and write the following commands in it:

## In this project I used libraries such as:
* redux
* react-redux
* redux-thunk

# TDD
In the project, I used the TDD approach, which allowed me to speed up writing code.
To check Tests, use the command:
### `yarn test`
There is not much testing in this project, but I try to always adhere to the principle of TDD and OOP.
